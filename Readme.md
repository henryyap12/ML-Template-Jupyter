# Machine Learning Project Experiment Template
This is the template for constructing modular machine learning and deep learning project in Jupyter Notebook. We use jupyter notebook because its a great tool for us to done experiment project as we want to identify the bugs and error as fast as possible during the experiment process. 

Jupyter notebook also allow us to save the finalized code into ```.py``` (python) format for the deployment purposes. This is an important feature that allows us to easily deploy our project to cloud computing server. 

In this repository, a proper project management guide is introduced for code reuse purposes. The branch ```template``` is the clean tree structure of how "Don't repeat yourself" principle is introduced while the branch ```main``` is that show the how the code implementation work.
